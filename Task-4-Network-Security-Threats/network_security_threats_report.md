## Introduction

Network security threats are malicious activities designed to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network systems.  
With the increasing reliance on digital communication, understanding these threats is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure network operations.

---

## Types of Network Security Threats

### Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS)

A DoS attack aims to overwhelm a system with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.  
A DDoS attack uses multiple compromised systems to launch the attack simultaneously.

**Impact:**
- Server downtime  
- Service disruption  
- Financial loss  

---

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

In a MITM attack, an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.

**Common Scenarios:**
- Public Wi-Fi networks  
- Unsecured communication channels  

---

### Spoofing

Spoofing occurs when an attacker impersonates a trusted device, IP address, or user to gain unauthorized access.

**Types:**
- IP spoofing  
- Email spoofing  
- ARP spoofing  

---

### Packet Sniffing / Eavesdropping

Packet sniffing involves capturing data packets traveling over a network to extract sensitive information.

**Risk:**
- Password theft  
- Data leakage  

---

### DNS Spoofing / Poisoning

DNS spoofing redirects users to malicious websites by corrupting DNS records.

**Result:**
- Phishing attacks  
- Malware infection  

---

## Impact of Network Security Threats

Network security threats can result in:
- Data breaches  
- Financial losses  
- Loss of customer trust  
- Legal and compliance issues  

---

## Real-World Examples

- DDoS attacks on banking websites  
- MITM attacks on public Wi-Fi  
- DNS spoofing used for phishing scams  

---

## Mitigation and Preventive Measures

- Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems  
- Encrypt network traffic  
- Keep systems updated  
- Use strong authentication mechanisms  

---

## Best Practices for Organizations

- Regular security audits  
- Employee cybersecurity training  
- Network monitoring  
- Backup and recovery planning  

---

## Conclusion

Understanding common network security threats is crucial for building secure systems.  
By implementing preventive measures and best practices, organizations can reduce risks and protect their network infrastructure.
